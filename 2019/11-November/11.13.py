    You are given a list of n numbers, where every number is 
    at most k indexes away from its properly sorted index. 
    Write a sorting algorithm (that will be given the number k) 
    for this list that can solve this in O(n log k)

    Example:
    Input: [3, 2, 6, 5, 4], k=2
    Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    As seen above, every number is at most 2 indexes away from its proper sorted index.
